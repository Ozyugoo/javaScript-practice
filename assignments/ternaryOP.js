// The Conditional (Ternary) Operatorï»¿
// If your country's population is greater than 33 million, use the ternary operator to log a string like this to the console: "Portugal's population is above average". Otherwise, simply log "Portugal's population is below average". Notice how only one word change between these two sentences!

// After checking the result, change the population temporarily to 13 and then to 130. See the different results, and set the population back to original.

const country = "Nigeria";
let population = 218.5;

console.log(`${country}'s population is ${population > 33 ? 'above' : 'below'} average`);
